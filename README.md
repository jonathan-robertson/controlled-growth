## Summary

7 Days to Die Modlet: Reduce loot stage bonus multipliers for a more controlled growth experience.

TFP added a mechanic to support bonuses to Loot Stage while in more difficult biomes. While this originally sounded exciting (and to some degree, it was!), the fun wore off fairly quickly as players began receiving end-game gear in Tier 1 Wasteland after reaching level 100.

This is not the way to keep a game or server feeling fresh for multiple months, so I've finally adjusted these mechanics.

## Reasoning

I am personally *in favor* of loot bonuses when exploring more dangerous areas - *it only makes sense*, after all, since fewer survivors would explore these areas. **These adjustments should be carefully balanced against the added risk one is taking**, however... and after playing A20 for a long, long time, it's my opinion that the Wasteland does not justify a greater than 2.5x increase to Loot Stage.

Instead, I've opted for the changes listed below.
